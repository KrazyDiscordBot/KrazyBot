## Introduction
Krazy bot is an multi purpose discord bot but now **discontinued**, The reason for discontinuing and for open sourcing the bot are available [here](https://gist.github.com/KartikeSingh/ad27c2ff303f974e79070ecfafa6bb70).

## About Code
Well this code is not 100% complete like
- XP category is left
- Testing is left ( Because prior to making the code public it was divided into two portions )

## What can you do?
Well if you want you can just fork or clone the repo and use it for your own bot but you will need to give credit to us as mentioned in the [gist here](https://gist.github.com/KartikeSingh/ad27c2ff303f974e79070ecfafa6bb70). If you want to re start the krazy bot just message me I might give you the right to :D
